The Annual UCSF Radiology Research Conference was held again at Asilomar in 2023, in my opinion a beautiful, iconic California coast setting to enjoy while growing as researchers!

The Body Imaging Group was most notably represented in a Hot Topics lecture by Prof. Galaetia Kazakia, speaking on *Virtual Bone Biopsy: Harnessing the power of high-resolution skeletal imaging*.  Her research uses a variety of imaging tools, including DXA, CT (including HP-pQCT) and MRI synergistically to study bone structure and function.  By harnessing imaging at different scales, from tissue samples to human studies, they can perform development of new methods, discovery, and translation.

Our group was also well represented in other presentations, including power pitches on quantitative UTE MRI of tendons, performing bone quality measurements and the impact of chronic kidney disease on bone quality (winner of a poster award!), breast imaging phantoms, MRI of hip oseoarthritis, performing automatic measurements of liver fat, and more.

A few other sessions I enjoyed were the Team Science exercise, which mixed our expertise, experience, and background to think big about problems and how we might attack them.  There were also informative sessions on career development and time management, where the latter shed insight into this issue we probably all face every day!

The keynote speaker was Prof. Ke Sheng, a relativley new UCSF faculty who came from UCLA and is in the Department of Radiation Oncology where his research focuses on radiotherapy to improve delivery.
I think he was invited because there are many opportunities for imaging in his and other radiation oncology research, including more precise treatment target definition (e.g. with MRI), real-time target tracking (e.g. MRI-linac systems, although UCSF does not have one of these systems), and improved treatment response monitoring (e.g. longitudinal measurements of ADC during and after treatment).
