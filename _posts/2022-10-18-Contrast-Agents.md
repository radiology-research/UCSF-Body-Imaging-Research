Professor Ben Yeh and team members Yuxin Sun, Korawan Vijittrakkarnrung, and Maurice Heimer, presented on their research developing novel CT and MRI contrast agents. These developments were motivated by the limited effectiveness of current CT contrast agents, particularly for visualization of bowel disease, and challenges in CT contrast agent delineation when using multiple agents.

The studies presented focused on oral DBCM, a novel experimental Dark Borosilicate Contrast Material. This agent has undergone initial clinical trials by Nextrast, a startup company which has licensed the UCSF technology for this agent, as a step stone toward FDA approval.

The research group showed phantom studies on the contrast that showed its impact on delineation of fine structures and iodine contrast, as well as extending DBCM for use as an MRI contrast agent.

The presentation also touched on the development of a tantalum-based intravenous contrast agent that may provide improved imaging for cardiovascular disease and cancer than possible with current iodine agents.
